### About the Project: Data Structure Implementation (Mysterious Safeguards)
This project is about writing a program to find the lifeguard that has minimum impact on pool coverage, when the pool owner hired an additional life guard. Finding the guard with minimum impact and the hours that can still be covered if a guard is removed. 

### About the Data:
The data provided includes 10 scenarios input text files(not committed in the repo);

`1.in`: scenario 1

.

.

.


`10.in`: scenario 10

### Programming Language and Libraries used:
`Python`- The code should run using Python version 3.8

### Project Structure:
The project has following three elements:

`README.md`: read me file


`impact_factor.py` - source code to process the data, create functions and generate recommendation as an output csv file

`requirements.txt`

### Instructions for execution
A. To execute the project and get the results follow the steps below: NOTE: Pycharm is used as IDE

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up a virtual environment in the project's root directory
3. Open a terminal in the project directory and run the following steps:
4. `python3 -m virtualenv venv`
5. `source venv/bin/activate`
6. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

B. To run the project:

1. Run the `impact_factor.py` file to get the output
2. All the helper functions are above `if __name__ == '__main__'`
3. Step by step processing of the data and getting the output is below the `if __name__ == '__main__'`

### The final result/ recommendations can be found in the following file-
1. output
